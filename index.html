                <h2> Become A Partner </h2>
                <p> We believe that no single actor can ensure rights. This necessitates the need for multi-dimensional
                    partnerships with key players such as government, civil society, people's movements, alliances,
                    networks, forums, NGOs, donors and the media in carrying forward and strengthening policy advocacy
                    work.
                    Partnership Policy (PP) is essentially a language of communication among the entities that
                    constitute
                    partnership. </p>
